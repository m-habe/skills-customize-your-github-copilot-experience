# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests and responses, and practice working with JSON data.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a Simple FastAPI Server

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI application that runs a web server and exposes basic API endpoints.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Start a FastAPI server
- Provide a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message
- Use proper Python file structure and comments

### 🛠️ Implement CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to create, read, update, and delete items (e.g., tasks, notes, or products) using FastAPI.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define a data model using Pydantic
- Implement endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
- Accept and return JSON data
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., item not found)

### 🛠️ Test Your API

#### Description
Write example requests (using curl or Python's requests library) to test your API endpoints.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Include sample requests for each endpoint in the README or a separate file
- Demonstrate successful and error cases
